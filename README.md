# CUDA_Newton_Fluids
A general CUDA implementation of Newton-GMRES for finding equilibria (and possibly more) for the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. 

# Dependencies
1. CUDA Toolkit
2. GSL
3. ncurses

# Finite Differencing
This code implements an approximation to the Euler and Navier-Stokes using finite differencing (FD). There is a MATLAB scirpt for generating FD macros to arbitrary order.
